# How to make the most of this

So you are in the program, you are learning the technical skills, building projects, etc.

How can you be more successful at Get Coding?

## 1. Build Real Shit

Don't limit yourself to building imaginary projects. You have the skills to build real shit, even get paid for it, and impact the world. Many of our students find some small paid work even before graduating.

By building real projects, you are:
- adding to your portfolio/resume
- learning new things
- expanding your network
- and maybe get paid for it

:::tip How do I build real-world projects?
- Friends & Family: anyone in your network require a website/app? Maybe an artist or self-employed person?
- Businesses without websites: restaurants, Airbnb's, camp sites, local art shops, mechanics, ... I could go on.
- Startups: there are many entrepreneurs without tech skills in the Genesis Centre wishing they knew someone to build their idea
- Build something useful: do you have an idea for an app or website? E.g. cheapest flights in NL
- Volunteering: do the above for free, or find a worthy not-for-profit needing your skills

## 2. Get Involved

A lot of fun stuff happens in tech: Meetups, Hackathons, Startup Weekends, Webinars, Workshops, ...
