# When you get a job offer

First of all, CONGRATULATIONS! You are 99% done.

:::warning
Employment offers can be rescinded. This happens rarely, either due to economic turmoil or if you somehow mess up:

- bad review from your references
- negotiating too hard
- communicating poorly or unprofessionally
- going silent or taking too long to respond
:::

Here are a some tips:

### Employment Agreement

You should receive a letter from the employer including your title, salary, and starting date. This is the employment agreement. There are usually other details such as vacation, benefits, responsibilities, etc.

Review it carefully.

### Let us know

As soon as you get the offer, let Sahand or Jan know. They can help you understand the offer better and provide some insights about the company.

### Should I negotiate the offer?

Since you are a junior in this sector you don't have much choice, so you don't want to negotiate anything strongly. If you have any concerns, let Sahand or Jan know and they'll help you out.

Feel free to negotiate the starting date. Generally, it's ok to move it a couple weeks. Be clear and honest in your communications and explain why, e.g. trip, notice to current job, ... 

You don't have any negotiating power over: vacation, benefits, probationary period, ... . These are generally decided at the company-level and not per individual.

### Get Ready

If you are feeling energetic, contact your future manager and ask for things you can do to speed up your onboarding, e.g. learning a new programming language or framework, tools like jira, etc.

If you are feeling tired of all the learning, take this time to rest and focus before the onboarding starts.


### Onboarding and Probationary Period

A business can legally lay off employees for no cause quite easily. This is even legally easier for employers during the probationary period (mostly 3 months).

The probationary period is the time that management is closely evaluating you at your new job. Ensure that you are doing your best in this period. If you experience any challenges, the Get Coding community is there to provide you with feedback and insights.

### Slack Message

After you sign the offer and are sure things are moving forward, please send a message in the #general channel in Slack. This greatly motivates other students.

Also don't forget to thank your instructors individually either in the same message or personally. They would really appreciate it. Maybe buy them a gift too. üòÅ
