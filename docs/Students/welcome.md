## Getting Started

1. Please install Slack's desktop and mobile apps to ensure you are always in touch. 

2. Update your name/profile picture in Slack. Then, introduce yourself in the #general channel.

3. Let's set some expectations:

:::tip You can expect us to:
- give you honest feedback, bad or good
- give you timely and relevant guidance
- help you establish a professional network
:::

:::info We expect you to:
- give us honest feedback, bad or good
- be responsible for your own success, while we guide you through the process
- give your coach at least 24 hours' notice if you can’t make it to your session
:::

<br></br>

4. Let Jan & Sahand know when you are done with the above.


## First Session Preparation
While waiting to connect with your coach and have your first session, you can do a few things to speed up your learning:

### 1. Install necessary tools

- Download and Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Make a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) Account

### 2. Git and Github

Learn what Git and Github are and why they are important:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos

We strongly recommend you to create a GitHub account and for each of your projects to have its own repository.

### 3. Think of a project

Actually building something is the most important part of learning how to code. From the very first session, you will start working on a project with the help of your coach, but we want you to choose the project. It should be something that helps you in day-to-day life or something you would enjoy building. 

There are 2 limitations to keep in mind for your first project:
- You cannot have Users Profiles, Login, Registration etc.
- You cannot store the information provided by the user between refreshes (you will learn all these later in the program)

(you will learn how to do the above in the back-end module)

You may think every web application needs these features, but look at what our students have built: 
- [Classroom Planner](https://chadmroberts88.github.io/classroom-planner/)
- [Todo/Planner](https://millerm30.github.io/todo/)
- [Measurement Convertor](https://clarko1391.github.io/Shop-APPrentice/)
- [Simple Survival Game](https://hello-world-software-studios.github.io/lumberdome/)


:::tip
If you can't think of a project, this might help:

During your everyday life, or during your interests or hobbies - is there any problem that you would like to solve? Or a nice thing to have?

Example 1: Becca likes Dungeons and Dragons, and has been playing for a while, but she found that creating new characters for new players is always overwhelming, so she created a Dungeons and Dragons character builder that reduces the amount of information but helps new players get started much quickly and easily.

Example 2: Steve has studied to be a screenwriter. When thinking about a script he wants to watch movies with a similar genre fusion, setting, characters, plot etc. However, he doesn’t know of a tool that would allow him to look up movies with such specific search queries, so he is building a tool to help him (using a number of movie database APIs). His tool then recommends a number of movies that match his search criteria. 

Example 3: Do you like investing? Why not build a simple dashboard that tracks how some stocks are doing?
:::

For your project:
- Write down the features of the web application you want to build
- On a piece of paper sketch what it should look like
- Create a GitHub Repository
- Start with the HTML/CSS structure - don’t worry about making it beautiful, just get started to gain momentum on the easy stuff
